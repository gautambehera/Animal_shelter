# Animal_shelter

This is a database schema for an animal shelter. The schema consists of several tables:

 Colors: a lookup table that lists the possible colors that an animal can have.

 Species: a lookup table that lists the possible species of animals that the shelter handles.

 Animals: a table that stores information about each animal that the shelter takes care of. This table has foreign key constraints to the Colors and Species tables.

 Staff: a table that stores information about each staff member working at the shelter.

 Staff_Roles: a lookup table that lists the possible roles that a staff member can have at the shelter.

 Staff_Assignments: a table that links staff members to their roles at the shelter.

 Adoptions: a table that stores information about each adoption that takes place at the shelter. This table has foreign key constraints to the Animals and Persons tables.

The schema is well-designed and uses normalization to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity. It includes foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity between tables. Overall, the schema provides a solid foundation for managing the animal shelter's data.
